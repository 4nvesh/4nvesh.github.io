					I completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. I've recently expanded my interests as a side project to check out several emerging technology fields like computer science and web development. 
					I've seen some great opportunities out there, and I want to pursue my goal of obtaining new skills while learning more about the technology that I'm working with.
				</p>
				<p class="mystory-para">
					I also have skills in digital artistry, such as portraiture using Clip Studio Paint and Photoshop. Further, I finished a few digital portraitures of my beautiful friends. 
					My interest in digital portrait painting started a year ago. But, it ended earlier than I expected because of the fear of not measuring up to the other's expectations.

				<h2  class="mystory-heading">I know mechanical engineers who have switched over to computer science.</h2>
				<p class="mystory-para">
					Mechanical engineering is a difficult degree to get into and the one with the least hiring opportunities.
					 Luckily, computer science is one of the fastest-growing degrees and has a lot of available jobs that can help provide a source of income in the future.
				</p>
				<p class="mystory-para">
					I have seen people around me get stuck in long-term career paths, working long hours for low-paid jobs.
					 As a mechanical engineer, I acquired a wide range of technical and soft skills, including problem-solving, communication skills,
					  and the ability to produce computer-aided drawings and designs. However, due to some changes in recent years, it may not be as lucrative for me.

					I had no clear idea of what I wanted to do in life. In addition, my bachelor's grades are too poor to continue study in computer science at a foreign university.

				<p class="mystory-para">
					I'd been curious about programming for some time, and the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science, an entry-level course taught by David J. Malan had been on my radar for a while, and it was immensely helpful to me.
					 I am currently seeking employment and intend to take a web development course.
